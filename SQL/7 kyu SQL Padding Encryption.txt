My solution:


SELECT
CONCAT(md5, REPEAT( '1', (LENGTH(sha256)-LENGTH(md5)))) AS md5,
CONCAT(REPEAT('0', (LENGTH(sha256)-LENGTH(sha1))) ,sha1) AS sha1,
sha256
FROM encryption;


Better solution:

select RPAD(md5, length(sha256), '1') md5,
       LPAD(sha1, length(sha256), '0') sha1,
       sha256
  from encryption
